    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Desserts need to tick three very simple boxes for the healthy
        individual: Easy to make, protein-filled, and few ingredients.
    </p><p>
        The egg cake achieves all three, as it only uses <strong>one</strong>
        ingredient and has plenty of protein to fill anyone up. Not only
        that, but it's just so easy to make!
